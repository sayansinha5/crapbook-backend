## Things to understand here for seeder.

Below is the folder structure
```
├── config/
│   └── database.ts
├── database
    └── seeder/
        └── main/
            └── index.ts
```

**Note**: The ```config/database.ts``` is configured to use seeders from ```database/seeders/main``` (paths: ['database/seeders/main']). It will automatically run the seeders in the ```database/seeders/main``` directory.

Since, this main directory contains only one seed file, namely ```index.ts```, it will run that file only. But that index.ts contains multiple seeders, which are imported and run one by one in ordered sequence. So, thus maintaining the order of seed files is very important.

#### Optional: Running a single seed file
Suppose, you want to run a single seed file, say ```role_seeder.ts```. You can do so by running the following command:
```
node ace db:seed --files="./database/seeders/role_seeder.ts"
```

#### Tip: Running seeder in interactive mode
You can run the seeder in interactive mode by running the following command:
```
node ace db:seed -i
```
